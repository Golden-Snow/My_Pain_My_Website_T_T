So to start my documentation, I have started my task on the 28.02.2025 at 15:38.
I am right now using the Phoenix Code editor to make my code, and testing with a local hosting using,
GO that i have downloaded and ran from command prompt using: "go run main.go", running http://localhost:8080/ .

So far i have been testing out how using go as the server works and made a simple html page.
I am in the current phase of figuring out the api calls and seeing what data i can get from the two different API's,
I have also made GO able to display the FrontEnd files like the HTML.

I am still struggling with the fetches to the API's and in the process of using the WEBdev tools in the browser to
figure out why my code is not fetching anything from the API's. So far no luck here and i am looking into the 
connection of my javascript and html working with the go server.

28.02.2025 at 16:58.
I have figured out that the javascript i made has failed to load into the webpage using the console on the webpage. 
I am looking into this right now.

a simple typo in the html failed the javascript from running, this is now fixed and the fetch requests are made.
Now its about seeing what i have gotten from the API fetch and figure out what can be used and so on. so far looking
good! :3
